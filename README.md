# WoW Codex

WoW Codex is a bunch of tools and web pages for developing WoW
addons. This is mainly targeted to 1.12 client but this could also be
useful for other versions.

> [!CAUTION]
> A lot of these resources like image assets are the property of Blizzard
> so bare that in mind. I do not own any of those assets.

More information about tools is located under each directory.
